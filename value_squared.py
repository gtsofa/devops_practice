'''Let's think about the steps needed to 
write a function that returns a number's squared value
'''
#understand the problem
#solve problem manually
#make manual solution better
#write pseudo code 
#replace pseudo code w real code

#solution
#initialize number by b 
#multiply number b by itself
#display multiplication results

def number_squared(b):
  """returns a number's squared value"""
  return b**2 
  
#testing
test1 = number_squared(4)
print(test1)
